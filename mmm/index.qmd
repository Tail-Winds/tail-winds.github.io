# Listening for Marine Mammals

A Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) listening array will asses any long term changes in marine mammal behaviors associated with offshore wind development. In collaboration with Cornell University scientists, UMCES will deploy a hydrophone array including rockhoppers ( detecting large whales and dolphins) and F-PODS (detecting echolocation clicks of dolphins and porpoises ). The arrangement of the array will assist analysts in assessing when and where marine mammals occur in the US Wind development area.

# Listening devices

## Rockhoppers

Rockhoppers continuously record sounds underwater, collecting data that will tell us about the presence of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, other baleen whales, and bottlenose and common dolphins.

## F-PODS

F-PODS log detailed information on echolocation clicks of dolphins and porpoises [www.chelonia.co.uk](https://www.chelonia.co.uk). Unlike the rockhoppers, these devices do not record the entire soundstream of the underwater environment but rather are specific to dolphins and porpoises.

# Seasonality of Marine Mammals

Marine Mammals can be detected offshore Maryland year round. However, specific species can only be found during specific times of the year. These seasonal patterns correlate with migration to and from favored feeding and breeding grounds. Marine mammals found offshore Maryland include a variety of different dolphin species, harbor porpoise, and baleen whales.

# Sounds of Marine Mammals

## Bottlenose Dolphins ![](images/Dolphin_Scaled.png)

Dolphins are very social vocal species that use many different sounds for a variety of behaviors. Some of the sounds they make include: echolocation clicks, buzzes, and whistles. Clicks are buzzes indicate foraging behavior and whistles are used for social communication. Dolphins are known to emit individually unique whistles known as signature whistles. These whistles share the identity of an individual with other dolphins and are known to be stable for decades. Identifying signature whistles in audio recordings allows scientists an opportunity to track individuals temporally and spatially, a benefit when one is wondering if the same dolphins are returning to the same area year after year
