**UMCES TAILWINDS** is a coordinated program assessing the impacts of offshore wind to Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) fisheries, whales, dolphins, porpoises, turtles, and migratory fishes. A portfolio of industry, state, and federal grants and assets are supporting:

1. Long-term research and monitoring of commercial and recreational fishery fleets and their adaptation to offshore wind development;
2. Long-term research and monitoring of the distribution and ecology of marine mammals and migratory fishes as they are affected by offshore wind development and ocean conditions;  
3. Near-real time surveillance and dynamic ocean management of baleen whales through a satellite-linked ocean listening buoy; 
4. Ocean observing system data synthesis, development of soundscape assessments, and quantitative models of cetacean and migratory fish distributions in offshore wind project areas.  

**TAILWINDS** assets include:

1. Passive acoustic monitoring assets (MARU, Rockhopper, C/F-POD, LS-1X) designed to localize and record behaviors of cetaceans in near and mid-shelf MAB waters (2014- 2017; 2021-present[^1]). 
2. Biotelemetry assets (VR2AR, VR2W) designed to transect migration flyways of electronically-tagged sharks, fishes and turtles (2014-2018; 2022-present[^1]).  
3. Autonomous buoy ([Ocean City buoy](https://dcs.whoi.edu/mdoc2410/mdoc2410_mdoc.shtml)) for sub-hour telemetry and analyst identification of endangered North Atlantic right whales and other baleen species (2021-present). 
4. MAB shelf array of acoustic assets (C/F-POD, LS-1X, VR2AR) in support of integrated soundscape, oceanographic, and biodiversity measures (2024-present, <https://marinebon.org/us-mbon/mid-atlantic-mbon/>).
