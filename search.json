    "text": "Monitoring for Whales in real-time\nUMCES TailWinds is supported in 2022-2023 by US Wind to oversee deployment of the Ocean City Real-time Whale Buoy (RTWB), listening for fin, humpback, sei and North Atlantic right whales. Built and deployed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and purchased by the MD Department of Natural Resources, the Ocean City RTWB is deployed 27 miles offshore in the US wind MarWin Project area and represents the southernmost RTWB system in a network of whale listening stations that extends into the Gulf of Maine. This RTWB records audio, processes it with an on-board classification algorithm and at two hour intervals, transmits data via iridium satellite communications daily to the Robots4Whales website. This data is reviewed daily by UMCES scientists who confirm whales calls and send alerts to a Whale Alert network and informs National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration’s alerts to marine traffic to avoid endangered North Atlantic right whales within Slow Zones. Listen to Dr. Helen Bailey’s podcast below for more information.\n\n\n Sounds that whales make within the detection range of the RTWB recorder are transmitted from the buoy via iridium satellite communications to a computer where analysts can review the data for the presence of whales at the Robots4Whales website. Any whales detected are shared with the public through the Robots4Whales website and apps (BOEM’s Ocean Alert, Whale Alert, and Mysticetus)."

    "text": "From Our Scientists\n\nThe Music of Whales\nImagine yourself in a rainforest. The air is hot and humid, the smells of the environment surround you: damp soil, decomposing wood, and plants,so many different types of plants. Now imagine what you might hear; the croaks, barks, whirring of frogs, the chirp and buzz of insects, the songs and calls of birds, monkeys calling to each other with yips, screeches and shouts. So many different species being heard at the same time in the same ecosystem.\nWhere sound is such a vital part of marine mammals’ lives, it should be unsurprising that many different species can be vocalizing at the same time within the marine ecosystem, similarly to a terrestrial ecosystem. Every marine mammal has a distinct sound(s) they make that are unique to that species. For those who may not know much about the marine environment, they may find it remarkable to know that many different marine species can be vocalizing at the same time. The Ocean City, MD Real-time Whale Buoy transmitted data via satellite containing this exact scenario on 31 January, 2023. Three different baleen whale species were identified vocalizing within the same 15 minute period.\n\nAlmost like a of sheet of music this period depicts the composition of all the playing parts of a musical underwater. In the higher frequencies at 400Hz across the panels you can see the melody, the humpback song pattern, shown by pitchtracks (alike to notes on a music sheet) with upsweeps and downsweeps. And in the background the harmony of faint North Atlantic right whale upcalls at 200Hz above 20 seconds in the first panel and 11 seconds in the second panel. Finally, the fin whales with the bass, the part of the musical composition that human ears cannot hear because it is so low frequency. This sound is a steady pulse at 20Hz labeled with a four underneath. UMCES scientists are given a preview of this composition and will be able hear the audio after the recording data has been collected. For now, this is a reminder that no matter what ecosystem you are in, there is always the chance to hear many species at the same time. - Kirsten (Faculty Research Assistant)"

Some of the sounds they make include echolocation clicks, buzzes, and whistles. Clicks and buzzes indicate foraging behavior, whereas whistles are used for social communication. Dolphins are known to emit individually-unique whistles called “signature whistles”. These whistles share the identity of an individual with other dolphins and are known to be stable for decades. Identifying signature whistles in audio recordings allows scientists an opportunity to track individuals temporally and spatially, a benefit when one is wondering if the same dolphins are returning to the same area year after year.\n\n\n\nThis video shows the spectrogram image and audio collected from an underwater recorder in the US Wind energy area. As the vertical bar scrolls across you can see and hear what dolphin clicks and whistles sound like. The repeated pattern of the same whistle is an example of a signature whistle."

Diet and physiological condition are assessed for sampled fish."

Four and two strings of 15 pots are respectively fished in the Project and Control areas in monthly surveys (March-November) for Before (’23-’24), During (’25-’26), and After (’27-’28) periods. Strings of pots emulate commercial deployments and also evaluate reef and spillover effects. Each string will terminate with an Edgetech ropeless device. This together with 1-day soak times will curtail interactions with protected species."
