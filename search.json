    "text": "Fin whales have arrived for the 2023 - 2024 migration season!\nSince February 2023, we’ve had 2 days of fin whales calling near the Maryland coast in September. Fin whales are the second largest whale on earth and the fastest swimmer of all baleen whales. We detect this species seasonally off of Ocean City, Maryland using the real-time whale buoy. Beginning late in August fin whales can be occasionally detected off the east coast of the United States. Once October comes around their detections are more frequent until March.\nFin whales produce very low-frequency pulses in a series lasting minutes to hours. They are identified by low-frequency 20 Hz pulse trains that can be heard across long distances up to 100 km. Fin whale sounds are so low-frequency they are not audible to the human ear, however you can listen to recordings of fin whales only when the sounds are sped up within the human hearing thresholds. Males produce these songs, possibly for breeding season, reproduction, and possibly to help other individuals find food.\nHere’s an image from one of our most recent detection of fin whales on September 30, 2023 where you can see repeated, low frequency pulses, every 9-10 seconds.\n\nIn the image below we can see fin whale calls including higher frequency harmonics. Harmonics (the parallel lines stacked above the 20Hz pulse) indicate that the whale may have been close to the buoy. These fin whale detections occurred on September 29, 2023.\n\nIn this image we have evidence there are at least 2 different individual fin whales singing. One fin whale (marked by orange arrows) appears to be closer to the buoy and the calls are louder and longer, appearing around 5, 15, 25, 35 seconds (upper panel). A second fin whale (marked by the blue arrows) may be further away from the buoy based on the fact the pulses are shorter and quieter, appearing around 18 and 38 seconds (upper panel) and 4 seconds (lower panel)."

    "text": "What Does a Dolphin Say?\nBottlenose dolphins  and common dolphins  produce a diversity of vocalizations to orient, feed, and socialize in their environment. Similar to a bat, dolphins produce biological sonar clicks to navigate and hunt. Echolocation clicks often occur in trains and are highly directional, meaning the energy in each click is focused in the forward direction and bounces off objects in the water. The returning echo tells the dolphin what, where, and how far the object is to inform its next move. Burst pulses are packets of high repetition pulses that include a range of sounds such as buzzes, squawks, and brays. They are the least characterized vocalization due to the diversity in pulsed call types and may be related to feeding, aggression, mating, and courtship. Whistles are tonal, narrow-band frequency modulated calls important for communication that vary in shape and structure. Dolphins use them in a variety of social contexts related to identification, localization, and group cohesion. Signature whistles are a type of whistle unique across individuals and are important for recognition of individuals in a social group.\n Listen to an example of whistles here"

Underwater close by the buoy, biological acoustic sensors were also deployed and included an LS-1X passive acoustic recorder. This device consists of a hydrophone and PVC housing for batteries and internal electronics. It collects underwater recordings in the frequency range of most dolphin vocalizations that we can analyze aurally and visually to better understand dolphin occurrence and behavior in this region over time. This type of recorder can be set on a recording cycle where it collects data for only some periods of time to save battery life, allowing for long-term monitoring of our study area!\n\n\n\n\nLS-1X"

    "text": "The Music of Whales\nImagine yourself in a rainforest. The air is hot and humid, the smells of the environment surround you: damp soil, decomposing wood, and plants,so many different types of plants. Now imagine what you might hear; the croaks, barks, whirring of frogs, the chirp and buzz of insects, the songs and calls of birds, monkeys calling to each other with yips, screeches and shouts. So many different species being heard at the same time in the same ecosystem.\nWhere sound is such a vital part of marine mammals’ lives, it should be unsurprising that many different species can be vocalizing at the same time within the marine ecosystem, similarly to a terrestrial ecosystem. Every marine mammal has a distinct sound(s) they make that are unique to that species. For those who may not know much about the marine environment, they may find it remarkable to know that many different marine species can be vocalizing at the same time. The Ocean City, MD Real-time Whale Buoy transmitted data via satellite containing this exact scenario on 31 January, 2023. Three different baleen whale species were identified vocalizing within the same 15 minute period.\n\nAlmost like a of sheet of music this period depicts the composition of all the playing parts of a musical underwater. In the higher frequencies at 400Hz across the panels you can see the melody, the humpback song pattern, shown by pitchtracks (alike to notes on a music sheet) with upsweeps and downsweeps. And in the background the harmony of faint North Atlantic right whale upcalls at 200Hz above 20 seconds in the first panel and 11 seconds in the second panel. Finally, the fin whales with the bass, the part of the musical composition that human ears cannot hear because it is so low frequency. This sound is a steady pulse at 20Hz labeled with a four underneath. UMCES scientists are given a preview of this composition and will be able hear the audio after the recording data has been collected. For now, this is a reminder that no matter what ecosystem you are in, there is always the chance to hear many species at the same time. - Kirsten (Faculty Research Assistant)"

Built and deployed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and purchased by the MD Department of Natural Resources, the Ocean City RTWB is deployed 27 miles offshore in the US wind MarWin Project area and represents the southernmost RTWB system in a network of whale listening stations that extends into the Gulf of Maine. This RTWB records audio, processes it with an on-board classification algorithm and at two hour intervals, transmits data via iridium satellite communications daily to the Robots4Whales website. This data is reviewed daily by UMCES scientists who confirm whales calls and send alerts to a Whale Alert network and informs National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration’s alerts to marine traffic to avoid endangered North Atlantic right whales within Slow Zones. Listen to Dr. Helen Bailey’s podcast below for more information.\n\n\n Sounds that whales make within the detection range of the RTWB recorder are transmitted from the buoy via iridium satellite communications to a computer where analysts can review the data for the presence of whales at the Robots4Whales website. Any whales detected are shared with the public through the Robots4Whales website and apps (BOEM’s Ocean Alert, Whale Alert, and Mysticetus)."

Some of the sounds they make include echolocation clicks, buzzes, and whistles. Clicks and buzzes indicate foraging behavior, whereas whistles are used for social communication. Dolphins are known to emit individually-unique whistles called “signature whistles”. These whistles share the identity of an individual with other dolphins and are known to be stable for decades. Identifying signature whistles in audio recordings allows scientists an opportunity to track individuals temporally and spatially, a benefit when one is wondering if the same dolphins are returning to the same area year after year.\n\n\n\nThis video shows the spectrogram image and audio collected from an underwater recorder in the US Wind energy area. As the vertical bar scrolls across you can see and hear what dolphin clicks and whistles sound like. The repeated pattern of the same whistle is an example of a signature whistle."

    "text": "What are we?\n\n\nUS Wind, Inc. is developing a wind farm in waters offshore of Ocean City, MD. In tandem with this development, UMCES TailWinds is undertaking a coordinated program of fishery resource and marine mammal monitoring. The program includes monitoring of (1) commercial and recreational fishery resources, with a focus on black sea bass; (2) marine mammals (cetaceans: whales, dolphins and porpoises), using a passive acoustic monitoring array and emphasizing large whales and dolphins; and (3) near real-time detections of baleen whales.\n\n\n\n\n\nFishery Resource Monitoring\nThe TailWinds team completed a pilot year last summer, comprising four monthly pot fishing trips and two bimonthly hook-and-line recreational trips between June and September 2022.\n\n\nReal-time Whale Monitoring\nJamie Testa and Kirsten Silva review daily acoustic transmissions from the near-real time whale buoy east of Ocean City, MD where ‘whale season’ has officially started! Over the past month they have detected critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales.\nThe real time whale buoy is listening for four baleen whales: fin, sei, humpback and North Atlantic right whales. Each species has specific sounds that can be identified through the use of pitch tracks (visual representations of sound from an audio spectrogram) that are transmitted via Iridium satellite from the buoy which is located within the US Wind lease area.\nAnyone can visit the Robots4Whales website and view acoustic detections which have been processed through a low-frequency detection and classification system (LFDCS) and displayed as colored lines (pitchtracks) for rapid, daily analysis."
