UMCES TailWinds is working with [Seaborn Seafood](https://www.instagram.com/seabornseafood), Ocean City MD (Captains Kerry, Cory, and Brandon Harrington) to test how black seabass pot fisheries will adapt and be impacted by turbine emplacement in the [US Wind MarWin Project](https://uswindinc.com/marwin). Four and two strings of 15 pots are respectively fished in the Project and Control areas in monthly surveys (March-November) for Before (‘23-’24), During (’25-’26), and After (‘27-’28) periods. Strings of pots emulate commercial deployments and also evaluate reef and spillover effects. Each string will terminate with an [Edgetech ropeless device](https://www.edgetech.com/product/5112-ropeless-fishing-system/). This together with 1-day soak times will curtail interactions with protected species.
