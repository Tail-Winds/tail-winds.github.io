The US Wind group at UMCES has been rebranded, and we’ll be providing quarterly updates to the CBL community starting right now! Check out our new project website: [https://tailwinds.umces.edu](https://tailwinds.umces.edu)

## Who are we?
The TailWinds group, **T**eam for **A**ssessing **I**mpacts to **L**iving resources from offshore **WIND** turbine**S**, is led by [Drs. Dave Secor](http://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#dr.-david-secor), [Helen Bailey](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#dr.-helen-bailey), and [Slava Lyubchich](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#dr.-vyacheslav-lyubchich) with support by student [Robert Bell](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#robert-bell) and Faculty Research Assistants [Mike O’Brien](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#mike-obrien), [Lauren Rodriguez](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#lauren-rodriguez), [Kirsten Silva](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#kirsten-silva), and [Jamie Testa](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/team/#jamie-testa). 

## What are we?

[US Wind, Inc.](https://uswindinc.com/) is developing a wind farm in waters offshore of Ocean City, MD. In tandem with this development, UMCES TailWinds is undertaking a coordinated program of fishery resource and marine mammal monitoring. The program includes monitoring of (1) commercial and recreational fishery resources, with a focus on black sea bass; (2) marine mammals (cetaceans: whales, dolphins and porpoises), using a passive acoustic monitoring array and emphasizing large whales and dolphins; and (3) near real-time detections of baleen whales.

### [Fishery Resource Monitoring](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/frm)
The TailWinds team completed a pilot year last summer, comprising four monthly pot fishing trips and two bimonthly hook-and-line recreational trips between June and September 2022.

### [Real-time Whale Monitoring](https://tailwinds.umces.edu/rtwb)
Jamie Testa and Kirsten Silva review daily acoustic transmissions from the near-real time whale buoy east of Ocean City, MD where ‘whale season’ has officially started! Over the past month they have detected critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales. 

The real time whale buoy is listening for four baleen whales: fin, sei, humpback and North Atlantic right whales. Each species has specific sounds that can be identified through the use of pitch tracks (visual representations of sound from an audio spectrogram) that are transmitted via Iridium satellite from the buoy which is located within the US Wind lease area.

Anyone can visit the [Robots4Whales](http://dcs.whoi.edu/mdoc0722/mdoc0722_mdoc.shtml) website and view acoustic detections which have been processed through a low-frequency detection and classification system (LFDCS) and displayed as colored lines (pitchtracks) for rapid, daily analysis.
