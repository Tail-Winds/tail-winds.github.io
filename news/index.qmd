# What Does a Dolphin Say?

Bottlenose dolphins ![](images/bottlenose dolphin.png){width="0.65in"} and common dolphins ![](images/common dolphin.png){width="0.75in"} produce a diversity of vocalizations to orient, feed, and socialize in their environment. Similar to a bat, dolphins produce biological sonar clicks to navigate and hunt. Echolocation clicks often occur in trains and are highly directional, meaning the energy in each click is focused in the forward direction and bounces off objects in the water. The returning echo tells the dolphin what, where, and how far the object is to inform its next move. Burst pulses are packets of high repetition pulses that include a range of sounds such as buzzes, squawks, and brays. They are the least characterized vocalization due to the diversity in pulsed call types and may be related to feeding, aggression, mating, and courtship. Whistles are tonal, narrow-band frequency modulated calls important for communication that vary in shape and structure. Dolphins use them in a variety of social contexts related to identification, localization, and group cohesion. Signature whistles are a type of whistle unique across individuals and are important for recognition of individuals in a social group.

## How Do We Monitor The Secret Lives of Dolphins?

The [Metocean Buoy](https://www.rpsgroup.com/services/oceans-and-coastal/metocean-science-and-technology/our-metocean-technology/metocean-buoy/) has been deployed in the Maryland Wind Energy Area (MWEA) by Ocean Tech Services (OTS) to measure and monitor wind conditions. It was first deployed in May 2021 and houses additional sensors for monitoring a range of environmental variables. Underwater close by the buoy, biological acoustic sensors were also deployed and included an [LS-1X](https://www.loggerhead.com/ls1-ls2-recorders) passive acoustic recorder. This device consists of a hydrophone and PVC housing for batteries and internal electronics. It collects underwater recordings in the frequency range of most dolphin vocalizations that we can analyze aurally and visually to better understand dolphin occurrence and behavior in this region over time. This type of recorder can be set on a recording cycle where it collects data for only some periods of time to save battery life, allowing for long-term monitoring of our study area!

Dr. Helen Bailey was quoted in the article [The Ocean Got so Loud That Dolphins Must Now 'Shout' Over Noise Pollution](https://impakter.com/the-ocean-is-getting-louder-dolphins-must-now-shout-over-noise-pollution/) 19 January, 2023.

[CBLOutreach (\@CBL Outreach)](https://twitter.com/cbloutreach/status/1621132848143941637?s=51&t=wv_MDv6-V_3WTIkktqz63Q)Tweeted: #Dolphins will adjust their calls in the face of underwater noise pollution, with Helen Bailey, research professor at @UMCES, describing it to the BBC as "similar to when we shout louder when we are talking in a noisy bar."

# Outreach 

## UMCES attends US Wind event 

Monday, July 10, 2023 UMCES was invited to attend an event hosted by US Wind for Maryland Governor Wes Moore and state officials to learn about the planned renovation of the Sparrows Point Steel, and interview key partners involved in the US Wind project. TailWinds PI Dave Secor and analyst Kirsten Silva provided overviews of  the TailWinds project. The Governor was particularly captivated by the sounds of humpback whales recorded by the Real-time Whale Bouy.

## The Music of Whales

Imagine yourself in a rainforest. The air is hot and humid, the smells of the environment surround you: damp soil, decomposing wood, and plants,so many different types of plants. Now imagine what you might hear; the croaks, barks, whirring of frogs, the chirp and buzz of insects, the songs and calls of birds, monkeys calling to each other with yips, screeches and shouts. So many different species being heard at the same time in the same ecosystem.

Where sound is such a vital part of marine mammals' lives, it should be unsurprising that many different species can be vocalizing at the same time within the marine ecosystem, similarly to a terrestrial ecosystem. Every marine mammal has a distinct sound(s) they make that are unique to that species. For those who may not know much about the marine environment, they may find it remarkable to know that many different marine species can be vocalizing at the same time. The Ocean City, MD Real-time Whale Buoy transmitted data via satellite containing this exact scenario on 31 January, 2023. Three different baleen whale species were identified vocalizing within the same 15 minute period.

Almost like a of sheet of music this period depicts the composition of all the playing parts of a musical underwater. In the higher frequencies at 400Hz across the panels you can see the melody, the humpback song pattern, shown by pitchtracks (alike to notes on a music sheet) with upsweeps and downsweeps. And in the background the harmony of faint North Atlantic right whale upcalls at 200Hz above 20 seconds in the first panel and 11 seconds in the second panel. Finally, the fin whales with the bass, the part of the musical composition that human ears cannot hear because it is so low frequency. This sound is a steady pulse at 20Hz labeled with a four underneath. UMCES scientists are given a preview of this composition and will be able hear the audio after the recording data has been collected. For now, this is a reminder that no matter what ecosystem you are in, there is always the chance to hear many species at the same time. - Kirsten (Faculty Research Assistant)
