In tandem with this development, UMCES TAILWINDS will undertake a coordinated program of fishery resource and marine mammal monitoring. The program includes monitoring of (1) commercial and recreational fishery resources, with a focus on black sea bass; (2) marine mammals (cetaceans: whales, dolphins and porpoises), using a passive acoustic monitoring array and emphasizing large whales and dolphins; and (3) near real-time detections of baleen whales."

Field deployments for all monitoring projects utilize Ocean City commercial fishing and recreational charter vessels, as well as the UMCES R/V Rachel Carson. The Fishery Resource Monitoring project evaluates reef and spillover effects and tests ropeless gear, the latter as a conservation measure against whale entanglement. The Marine Mammal Monitoring project deploys two types of listening devices: Rockhopper recorders designed by Cornell University to determine the occurrence and position of large whales (including North Atlantic right whales) and dolphins, and F-POD devices to detect the tonal echolocation clicks of small cetaceans including porpoises. Additionally, this project will deploy biotelemetry receivers to listen for passing fishes, sharks, rays and turtles that have been implanted with transponders. UMCES will also analyze US Wind’s Metocean buoy sensor data for fish and marine mammal detections."
