    "text": "UMCES TailWinds is working with Seaborn Seafood, Ocean City MD (Captains Kerry, Cory, and Brandon Harrington) to test how black seabass pot fisheries will adapt and be impacted by turbine emplacement in the US Wind MarWin Project. Four and two strings of 15 pots are respectively fished in the Project and Control areas in monthly surveys (March-November) for Before (’23-’24), During (’25-’26), and After (’27-’28) periods. Strings of pots emulate commercial deployments and also evaluate reef and spillover effects. Each string will terminate with an Edgetech ropeless device. This together with 1-day soak times will curtail interactions with protected species."

    "text": "US Wind, Inc. is developing Lease area OCS-A 0490 in waters offshore of Ocean City, MD. In tandem with this development, UMCES TAILWINDS will undertake a coordinated program of fishery resource and marine mammal monitoring. The program includes monitoring of (1) commercial and recreational fishery resources, with a focus on black sea bass; (2) marine mammals (cetaceans: whales, dolphins and porpoises), using a passive acoustic monitoring array and emphasizing large whales and dolphins; and (3) near real-time detections of baleen whales."

    "text": "Fishery Resource and Marine Mammal Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring projects follow a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) and Before-After-Gradient (BAG) design following the before (2022-2024), during (2025-2026), and after construction periods (2027-2028). Field deployments for all monitoring projects utilize Ocean City commercial fishing and recreational charter vessels, as well as the UMCES R/V Rachel Carson. The Fishery Resource Monitoring project evaluates reef and spillover effects and tests ropeless gear, the latter as a conservation measure against whale entanglement. The Marine Mammal Monitoring project deploys two types of listening devices: Rockhopper recorders designed by Cornell University to determine the occurrence and position of large whales (including North Atlantic right whales) and dolphins, and F-POD devices to detect the tonal echolocation clicks of small cetaceans including porpoises. Additionally, this project will deploy biotelemetry receivers to listen for passing fishes, sharks, rays and turtles that have been implanted with transponders. UMCES will also analyze US Wind’s Metocean buoy sensor data for fish and marine mammal detections."
