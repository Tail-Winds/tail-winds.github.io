Built and deployed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and purchased by the MD Department of Natural Resources, the Ocean City RTWB is deployed 27 miles offshore in the US wind MarWin Project area and represents the southernmost RTWB system in a network of whale listening stations that extends into the Gulf of Maine. This RTWB records audio, processes it with an on-board classification algorithm and at two hour intervals, transmits data via iridium satellite communications daily to the Robots4Whales website. This data is reviewed daily by UMCES scientists who confirm whales calls and send alerts to a Whale Alert network and informs National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration’s alerts to marine traffic to avoid endangered North Atlantic right whales within Slow Zones. Listen to Dr. Helen Bailey’s podcast below for more information.\n\n\n,"

The program includes monitoring of (1) commercial and recreational fishery resources, with a focus on black sea bass; (2) marine mammals (cetaceans: whales, dolphins and porpoises), using a passive acoustic monitoring array and emphasizing large whales and dolphins; and (3) near real-time detections of baleen whales."

Field deployments for all monitoring projects utilize Ocean City commercial fishing and recreational charter vessels, as well as the UMCES R/V Rachel Carson. The Fishery Resource Monitoring project evaluates reef and spillover effects and tests ropeless gear, the latter as a conservation measure against whale entanglement. The Marine Mammal Monitoring project deploys two types of listening devices: Rockhopper recorders designed by Cornell University to determine the occurrence and position of large whales (including North Atlantic right whales) and dolphins, and F-POD devices to detect the tonal echolocation clicks of small cetaceans including porpoises. Additionally, this project will deploy biotelemetry receivers to listen for passing fishes, sharks, rays and turtles that have been implanted with transponders. UMCES will also analyze US Wind’s Metocean buoy sensor data for fish and marine mammal detections."
