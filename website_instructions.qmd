## 1. R

You don't have to use R to do any of this -- it also will work with Jupyter notebooks or in the command line, e.g. For the purposes of this guide, I'm assuming that our current *lingua franca* is R.

So, if you don't have R installed on your machine, go ahead and [download it here](https://cran.r-project.org/), then install.

## 2. RStudio

Again, this isn't the only program that will do that, I'm just assuming that it's common language at this point. Download [by following this link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and install. I'm fairly certain that RStudio comes with a version of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the program we'll use to build the website, installed.

### 2a. Quarto

Just in case I'm wrong about that, [click here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to download Quarto, then install.

## 3. Git and GitHub

This is the hardest part. Seriously. Installing git is way more annoying than it should be. Luckily, there's a really good guide called [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html) that does a pretty good job walking through this process while being candid about the pitfalls.

The guide also walks you through signing up for GitHub, which is easy, free, and neccesary for you to access the website.

## 4. Download the website to your computer

This is also known as "cloning the repository" in Git/GitHub speak. I suggest using RStudio, following the [instructions in section 16.2.2 here](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html#rstudio-ide-1). Use https://github.com/Tail-Winds/tail-winds.github.io.git as the URL for the GitHub repository.

Now you're good to go!

## 5. Create/edit Quarto (.qmd) files for the desired page

The Quarto website has [really thorough guides](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) on how to do this. Slava and I are also on call via Slack!

Generally:

1. go to File > New File > Quarto Document to make a new page.
2. Edit the _quarto.yml file -- this serves as the website's map.
