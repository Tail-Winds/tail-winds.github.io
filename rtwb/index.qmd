![](images/HumpbackHawaiicropped.png) UMCES TailWinds is working with US Wind, MD DNR and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) to monitor for whales offshore Ocean City, Maryland. US Wind has funded a year monitoring for four baleen whale species: fin, humpback,sei and North Atlantic right whales using a real-time whale buoy (RTWB). This buoy records audio, processes it with a Low Frequency Detection and Classification system (LFDCS) and transmits data via iridium satellite communications daily to the Robots 4 Whales website. This data is reviewed daily by UMCES scientists for the presence of whales calls and whale detections are shared with apps: Whale Alert, BOEM's Ocean Alert, and Mysticetus. Listen to Dr. Helen Bailey's podcast below for more information.
